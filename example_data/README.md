# Example Data

Three polarized light microscopy images are provided for demonstration:

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `sample_1.tif` | Low crystal coverage — scattered birefringent domains |
| `sample_2.tif` | High crystal coverage — near-complete birefringence |
| `sample_3.tif` | Moderate crystal coverage — discrete clusters |

These images were acquired under crossed polarizers. Crystalline (birefringent)
regions appear bright against the dark amorphous background.

## Usage

```bash
python crystal_area_analysis.py --input example_data/ --output example_output/
```
